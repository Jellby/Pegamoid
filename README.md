Pegamoid
========

Pegamoid is an orbital viewer especially suited for use with
[OpenMolcas](https://gitlab.com/Molcas/OpenMolcas). It can be used to view
orbitals and quickly select active spaces for use in CASSCF or RASSCF
calculations.

Features
--------

The following formats can be opened:

* HDF5 files, as generated by some (Open)Molcas modules like SCF or RASSCF, if compiled with HDF5 support.

* InpOrb files, generated by some (Open)Molcas modules like SCF or RASSCF, provided an HDF5 file for the same system was opened first.

* [Molden](http://www.cmbi.ru.nl/molden/) files.

* [Luscus](http://luscus.sourceforge.net/) files, generated by the GRID_IT module.

* Grid files (ASCII), generated by the GRID_IT module.

* [Cube](http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/cube/) files (formatted).

For HDF5, InpOrb and Molden files, orbitals are computed on the fly from the
basis set, and it is possible to change the sampling resolution and shape and
size of the sampled volume. Luscus, grid and cube files contain precomputed
volumetric data and only the existing data can be displayed.

Depending on availability in the input file, the following features and objects
are supported:

* Selection of orbital.

* Selection of spin.

* Selection of symmetry irrep.

* Natural average or state-specific orbitals.

* Electron density and Laplacian.

* Natural average or state-specific spin orbitals.

* Spin density.

* Natural difference orbitals.

* Difference, attachment and detachment density.

* Natural transition orbitals.

* Transition, hole, particle and unrelaxed difference density.

For any orbital or density, gradient lines can be computed and displayed
(particularly significant for the electron density). Densities can be computed
for reduced subsets of orbitals (for instance, only for the active orbitals),
and the user can write arbitrary notes for each orbital.

The value, opacity, colors and texture properties used to display isurfaces can
be adjusted and the display of the following elements can be toggled:

* Positive and negative parts of the isosurface.

* Nodal surfaces.

* Nuclei and bonds.

* Atom labels.

* Volume box.

Finally, the type of orbital (inactive, active...) can be changed and the
orbitals saved in the following formats usable in the (Open)Molcas programs:

* HDF5 format.

* InpOrb format.

or the current volumetric data or snapshot can be saved as:

* Cube format.

* PNG image.

Tips for OpenMolcas
-------------------

Use the `TDM` keyword in a RASSCF calculation to include transition densities
in the HDF5 file.

Use the `TRD1` keyword in a RASSI calculation to include state and transition
densities in the HDF5 file. Use the `SUBSET` keyword to reduce the number of
transition densities stored.

Use the `WFA` module for more detailed analysis.

Installation
------------

The recommended way to install Pegamoid is by using the [`pip` package
manager](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#use-pip-for-installing):

    pip install Pegamoid

(you may also want to add the flags `--upgrade` and/or `--user`).

Then you just run:

    pegamoid.py [filename]

where ``[filename]`` is an optional supported file to open. In the case of
InpOrb files, you can supply two filenames (in any order): the InpOrb file and
a corresponding HDF5 file.

There are other ways to get Pegamoid. One is cloning the git repository, e.g.

    git clone https://gitlab.com/Jellby/Pegamoid.git

Another way, since Pegamoid is contained in a single python script, is
downloading only the script file
[pegamoid.py](https://gitlab.com/Jellby/Pegamoid/raw/master/pegamoid.py?inline=false).

Once the program is fetched, it can be run directly or through a python
interpreter, no installation is needed, i.e.

    ./pegamoid.py [filename]

or

    python pegamoid.py [filename]

However, the script has some requirements (this should be taken care of by
`pip`, if you use it) that must be installed for it to work:

* Python 2 or python 3 (at least versions 2.7 and 3.4 have been tested).

* Qt with python bindings. PyQt 4, PyQt 5 and PySide have been tested. It is
  recommended to install the python module qtpy (needed for PySide).

* VTK with python bindings. Version 8.1.0 has been tested, earlier versions
  will most likely not work.

* The numpy and h5py python modules.

* Other python modules that may not be installed by default, it should be clear
  which ones, if any, are needed when trying to run Pegamoid.

Use of scratch disk space
-------------------------

To speed up the display of several orbitals and the computation of densities,
Pegamoid uses some scratch disk space to store the computed basis functions. A
file named ``pegamoid.cache`` will be created in a temporary location (typically
inside the ``/tmp`` directory). For grids with many points and with many basis
functions, this file could grow very large and even use up all available disk
space. The maximum scratch size is by default 1 GiB, but it can be configured in
"File > Set scratch", or through the environment variable
``PEGAMOID_MAXSCRATCH``, e.g.:

    PEGAMOID_MAXSCRATCH=100MB ./pegamoid.py

for a maximum size of 100 MB. If the scratch size is not enough to hold all
basis functions at the current resolution, it will only be used when computing
the densities. In the "Set scratch" window you can also find the
instance-specific temporary path, as well as the maximum cache size, the scratch
size currently in use, and the recommended size to allow keeping a cache of all
basis functions. The scratch file and directory are removed on a clean exit, but
if the program crashes or is otherwise abnormally interrupted, they may be left
behind.

Use with a remote connection
----------------------------

Production calculations are usually not run on the local machine, but on some
remote server like a supercomputer. To view/save/modify orbital files, it is
always possible to transfer the files between the local and remote machines. It
is, however, more convenient to run Pegamoid directly on the remote machine and
have the graphical interface display in the local machine. Unfortunately, there
are some difficulties that make this nontrivial.

First, the different requirements may not be installed in the remote system. A
possible solution is installing them for the user account with e.g.
``pip install --user``. In this case it will probably be easier to install qtpy
and PySide instead of PyQt.

Then, the VTK visualization uses some advanced OpenGL features that may not be
available with all graphical drivers and it could be challenging to make it
work through a remote connection. We have had success running Pegamoid with
``vglrun`` inside a
[ThinLinc](https://www.cendio.com/thinlinc/what-is-thinlinc) session, or a VNC
session opened directly from an ssh connection. The specific needs and working
solution will probably depend on the hardware and software available in the
remote computer.

Known problems
--------------

In some systems there are display issues in the 3D window, where some elements
are wrongly drawn "on top" of others (this does not refer to the atom names,
which are always on top). This problem has been seen with PyQt 5, and it's
usually solved by switching to PyQt 4 or installing QtOpenGL support (in the
"About" dialog, check if the "Qt API" line says "with QtOpenGL"). To disable
QtOpenGL detection, define the environment variable ``PEGAMOID_NO_QGL=1``.

Issues with the "Transform" and "Texture" windows not appearing have also been
reported in some PyQt 4 versions. It is unclear at the moment what is the
reason for this.

When running in KDE Plasma 5, some shortcuts may not work because KDE tries to
be smart and overwrites them (see
[here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32688153) for example). To fix this,
you can add to the ``~/.config/kdeglobals`` file:

    [Development]
    AutoCheckAccelerators=false
